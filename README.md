# G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation

## Overview

The **G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation** is a web application designed to simulate the distance traveled by a ball when hit with an initial velocity, considering factors like the coefficient of restitution. This simulation provides an interactive way for users to visualize and understand the relationship between physics principles and motion. The web app features a cute and intuitive user interface, designed to make learning about these concepts engaging and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Interactive Calculation**: Input the initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution to simulate the ball's distance.
- **Real-time Results**: Instantly see the results of your input and how changing different variables affects the ball's trajectory.
- **Cute UX/UI**: Designed with a fun and friendly aesthetic to make the simulation more engaging and accessible for users of all ages.
- **Custom Animations**: Includes animations designed in Figma to enhance the user experience and make the simulation more visually appealing.

## How to Use

1. **Homepage**: The homepage introduces the application and provides easy access to all the main pages, including the simulation, contact information, and settings.
2. **Calculation Page**: Enter values for the initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution to simulate and view the ball's distance.
3. **Contact Page**: Provides users with information on how to get in touch for support or inquiries.
4. **Settings Page**: Allows users to adjust and reset simulation settings to their desired values.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the app
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for the logic behind the simulation and user interactions

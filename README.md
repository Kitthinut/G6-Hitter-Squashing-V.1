# G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation 🏓🎯

## Overview 🌟

The G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation is a web-based application created as an assignment for the FIBO (Institute of Field Robotics) subject **Robotics Studio I: Science in Motion (FRA163)**. The web app simulates the distance a ball travels when hit with a specific angle 🎾, with other factors such as initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution being customizable through the settings ⚙️. This project is designed with a cute and user-friendly interface 💖 to make your trauma simulation just like a rainbow 🌈.

## Features ✨

- **Angle-based Calculation 🔄**: Input the angle at which the ball is hit to calculate the distance it travels. Other factors such as initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution are adjustable in the settings.
- **Customizable Settings ⚙️**: Modify various factors like velocity and mass in the settings to see how they affect the simulation without needing to re-enter the angle.
- **Interactive and Cute UX/UI 🐾**: Designed with a friendly aesthetic to provide a fun and engaging experience for users of all ages.
- **Animations by 6713 🎨**: The simulation includes animations designed by my dear friend 6713, making the experience more visually appealing and dynamic.
- **Calculation Logic by 6721 🧠**: The core logic behind the calculations, including how the ball's trajectory is determined, is based on the work by 6721, ensuring accurate and realistic results.

## How to Use 📝

1. **Homepage 🏠**: The homepage introduces the application and provides easy access to all the main pages, including the simulation, contact information, and settings.
2. **Calculation Page 🧮**: Enter values for the initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution to simulate and view the ball's distance.
3. **Contact Page 📬**: Provides users with information on how to get in touch for support or inquiries.
4. **Settings Page ⚙️**: Allows users to adjust and reset simulation settings to their desired values.

## Technologies Used 💻

# G6 Hitter Squashing V.1 🏓🌸🎯

## Overview 🌟

The **G6 Hitter Squashing Simulation** is a web-based application created as an assignment for the FIBO (Institute of Field Robotics) subject **Robotics Studio I: Science in Motion (FRA163)**. The web app simulates the distance a ball travels when hit with a specific angle 🎾, with other factors such as initial velocity, racket mass, and coefficient of restitution being customizable through the settings ⚙️. This project is designed with a cute and user-friendly interface 💖 to make your trauma simulation just like a rainbow 🌈 and a sip of matcha on a spring day 🍵❀

## Features ✨

- **Angle-based Calculation 🔄**: Input the angle at which the ball is hit to calculate the distance it travels (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ ✧ Other factors are adjustable in the settings for your convenience.
- **Customizable Settings ⚙️**: Adjust velocity, mass, and more through a separate settings page to fine-tune your simulation 🌸.
- **Interactive and Cute UX/UI 🐾**: Styled with an adorable and friendly vibe, perfect for users of all ages (｡♥‿♥｡).
- **Animations by 6713 🎨**: Lovely animations made by my talented friend 6713 to make the simulation extra magical 🌈✨.
- **Calculation Logic by 6721 🧠**: Physics made cute and accurate by the genius 6721 — so your results are both reliable and fun ( •̀ ω •́ )✧.

## How to Use 📝

1. **Homepage 🏠**: Welcome to the app! Navigate to other pages easily from here 🌸.
2. **Calculation Page 📐**: Input only the **angle** of the hit and see how far the ball flies (ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ).
3. **Contact Page 📬**: Need help? Want to collab? Find contact info here ꒰⑅ᵕ༚ᵕ꒱˖♡.
4. **Settings Page 🍵**: Tweak the physics parameters like initial velocity, racket mass, and restitution to customize the behavior just how you like it (≧◡≦) ♡

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML** for structure 🏗️  
- **CSS** for stylish cuteness ✨  
- **JavaScript** for smart, interactive magic (ง •̀_•́)ง

            In recent years, sports technology has developed rapidly to meet the demands of athletes and coaches. One of the key innovations is the Squash Ball Hitting Machine, which has been designed to help squash athletes practice more effectively and continuously.
        </p>
        
        <p class="hover-effect">
            Squash is a sport that requires speed, accuracy, and quick reflexes. Traditional training typically requires a partner who can hit the ball in the right direction and rhythm, but in some situations, a practice partner may not be available, limiting the athlete's training.
        </p>
        
        <p class="hover-effect">
            Therefore, the Squash Ball Hitting Machine was developed to address this issue. The machine allows athletes to practice anytime and anywhere without relying on a partner. It is capable of adjusting the speed, direction, and pattern of the ball shots, enabling the athlete to train various skills effectively.
        </p>
        
        <p class="hover-effect">
            The development of the Squash Ball Hitting Machine involves knowledge from multiple disciplines, including mechanical engineering for the design of the structure and mechanism, electrical engineering for the motor and sensor systems, and computer science for simulating the training scenarios.
        </p>
        
        <p class="hover-effect">
            This project aims to design and build an automatic Squash Ball Hitting Machine, applying engineering principles from robotics, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering to create a functional prototype. The project is intended to result in a product that can be further refined and developed for commercial use in the future.
